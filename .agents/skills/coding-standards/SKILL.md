# Coding & Clean Code Standards

All code contributions must follow these clean coding standards:

## 1. Code Style & Self-Documentation

- **No Comments**: All code must be **self-documenting** and contain **no comments**.
- **Zero Warning Mandate**: The codebase must be free of lint warnings and formatting errors.
- **Intentional Omissions**: Use the **`_` (underscore)** prefix for any intentionally unused parameters, variables, or caught errors (e.g., `const { unused: _unused } = obj`, `catch (_err) {}`). The ESLint config is hardened to support this pattern without warnings.

## 2. Agent Constraints

The AI agent must **not**:

- make source control changes (commits, reverts, rebases, etc.) autonomously.
- bypass verification gates.

The AI agent **should**:

- perform dry code analysis.
- reason about control flow, concurrency, idempotency, and failure paths.
- surface likely bugs or race conditions early.

## 3. Native Identifier Strategy

- **Eliminate `uuid` Dependency**: To reduce security surface area and avoid CommonJS/ESM compatibility friction, **DO NOT** use the `uuid` npm package in the microservice.
- **Authority**: Use Node.js's built-in **`crypto.randomUUID()`** for all random identifier generation (ERCs, correlation IDs, task IDs).
